<h1>Git API</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to create an example API server/client which uses Git as the frontend/backend storage, and as the comms protocol.</p>
<p>There will be one "data" repo for the project, which the server will create and clients will clone.</p>
<p>Resources will be stored as .json files in a folder structure matching the URI structure of a restful API</p>
<p>A js git implementation will be used on the front-end application, with an in-browser filesystem for resource storage.</p>
